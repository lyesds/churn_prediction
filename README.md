### The project

The aim of this (learning) project is to analyse the characteristics and behaviours of bank customers
in order to:
- predict and limit the churn rate
- create clusters of resembling customers to design targeted communication campaigns

A dashboard accessible to all interested people in the company will showcase the findings.

### Data source

The dataset can be downloaded on the following link: [Credit Card Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers).

### How to use

For end users, just go to the [dashboard]() online. Here how it looks like:
